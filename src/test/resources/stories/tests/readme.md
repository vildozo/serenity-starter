# Tests

Stories that are ment to be part of your regular test suite should go in this folder. 
These are tests that will run multiple times against an environment. 

The folder structure is important and represents: Theme/Epic/story

I've setup just a few examples of basic tests.
The following are the themes: google, yahoo, bing
Each one just has one Epic of search in them. Realistically you would have many Epic under each theme.
